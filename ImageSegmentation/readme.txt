Description: the dataset consist of 143 images ER+ BCa images scanned at 40x. Each image is 2,000 x 2,000. Across these images there are about 12,000 nuclei manually segmented. The format of the files is:
12750_500_f00003_original.tif: original H&E image
12750_500_f00003_mask.png: mask of the same size, where white pixels are nuclei

Description: The file contains original images from two microscopes for two cell types stained with Hoechst 33342 as PNG files. It also contains images (as Photoshop and GIMP files) showing hand-segmentation of the Hoechst images into regions containing single nuclei.

Description: Human HT29 colon-cancer cells (diverse phenotypes). The image set consists of 56 fields of view (4 from each of 14 samples). The samples were stained with Hoechst 33342, pH3, and phalloidin. Hoechst 33342 is a DNA stain that labels the nucleus. Phospho-histone H3 indicates mitosis. Phalloidin labels actin, which is present in the cytoplasm. Each image is 512 x 512 pixels

It is a large publicly accessible data set of 120 hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained tissue images with more than 21000 painstakingly annotated nuclear boundaries (creo que no llegan ni a las 15 mil anotasiones), whose quality was validated by a medical doctor. This dataset spans 30 patients and seven organs taken from multiple hospitals and includes a diversity of nuclear appearances from several patients, disease states, and organs.
